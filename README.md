## Hi there 👋 My name is Ash

I’m an award winning creator, filmmaker, Antler Finalist, and Monash University alum (BSc Business Systems).  
For nearly 18 years, I’ve been building intellectual property across multiple industries — selling screenplays, working on Hollywood and British TV productions, with over 50 IMDb credits to my name.  

Along the way, I was the 4th runner-up on Malaysian Idol (yes, really!) and was honored as one of Augustman Magazine’s “Men of the Year” in 2015.  
It’s been a wild, unconventional journey — and it’s far from over.


### So what is a creative like me doing on GitHub?

Although I built my career in entertainment, my foundation has always been with tech.  
I graduated with a degree in Information Technology from one of the best universities in the world, and in 2017, I entered the blockchain space — investing and operating a 7-location mining facility (2018 was painful, to say the least).
  
In 2021 I discovered NFTs & Web3 — and instantly recognized the massive potential for Creators. It was the perfect collision of my right and left brain.

### What I discovered

- Decentralization was a powerful idea, but Web3 ecosystems were fragmented, projects existed in silos. Although promising decentralization, IP universes were isolated, unable to interact, collaborate, or grow together organically.
- Many creatives like myself faced high barriers to entry — needing multiple platforms, like Discord, technical expertise, and constant friction just to participate.  
- The very people Web3 was supposed to empower were being locked out.
- Web3 promised interoperability, but so far, it hasn’t made it **meaningful** for everyday Creators or fans.

## 🎨 The Problem We’re Solving

- Existing platforms like Discord are centralized, fragmented, and visually uninspiring — they weren’t designed for IP-driven community building.
- Social platforms like Instagram don’t allow Creators to own their audiences (Towns has addressed this).
- But even with better communication tools, there’s a deeper need: 
 
  **Creators need to turn their IP into living, thriving community economies — without studios, publishers, or middlemen, and find new ways to collaborate and co-own.**

## 🧠 Why the Metaverse Failed — and What We Learned

The Metaverse tried to solve the problem of disconnected virtual worlds —  but it failed to capture real adoption.

**Why?**

- **Too corporate**: It was a top-down initiative led by brands and enterprises, not by creators and communities.
- **Too clunky**: It required VR headsets and heavy hardware to experience properly — putting massive friction between people and creativity.
- **Too disconnected from real culture**: It tried to replicate physical spaces digitally, instead of building on living fandoms, lore, and collaborative storytelling. Communities were still gathering on X and Discord.
- **No true economic empowerment**: Most platforms remained centralized, offering little real ownership to the people who built them.

**In short:**  
The Metaverse tried to recreate the physical world —  
but it forgot the beating heart of the internet: *community and creativity.*

### What kept me up at night

- Imagine if every community wasn’t just a server you joined...
but a living space, filled with lore & imagination — able to evolve, merge, and be co-owned?

## 🌱 Our Vision: ESC/APE

ESC/APE is here to build something different, yet feels familiar.  

**Not a Metaverse. Not just a chat app.**  
**A living cultural infrastructure.**

✅ Our Value Proposition:

- ESC/APE is designed to plug directly into Towns Protocol — extending Towns’ core functionality by adding a decentralized IP and community-building layer specifically for Creators.

✅ Our Solution provides:

- *Dynamic landing pages* powered by NFT-based **variable state blocks** — allowing communities to **co-create** and **co-own** their spaces. What if owning NFTs from 2 communities creates a new space/town, co-owned together & fused together by shared Lore. 

- Infrastructure that empowers Creators to **own** their audiences, to **prove** their IP’s value through data & analytics, and **monetize** their creations through sustainable, community-driven revenue & referral models.

- A seamless, joyful ecosystem where **IP universes can interact, evolve, and merge** — without corporate walls.

**Because the future of creativity isn’t centralized.  
It’s decentralized, interconnected, and alive. 🚀**

## 🧩 Core Features

**NFT Variable Blocks as living modular Landing Pages**
- Instead of a Discord “Channel” with ‘start here’ to learn about the community.
- Imagine a **Netflix-styled interface**, visually driven, where a community’s story isn’t hidden inside ‘chat channels’ but displayed as a vibrant, artistic gateway into their world.
- And just like in a living world, entrances (or “gates”) reveal themselves differently depending on who enters — a **tourist** sees one thing, an **initiate** another.

**Gamified Dynamic Graphic Novel Reader:**
- Discovering your IP should feel like a journey — fun, gamified, and alive. 
- So what if a comic panel could dynamically unlock a portal into a parallel story, into another community or IP world? 
- And what if these panels can be mintable as the access key?

**Towns Protocol Native:** 
- Real-time communication, coordination, and governance. 

**XP and Reputation Systems:** Reward engagement & loyalty.

**Shared Worlds:** 
- Communities are encouraged to create portals between their spaces, collaborate on lore, and grow the collective shared IP layer together. Could multiple communities co-own a shared space, co-own resources, and earn revenue together?

**Current State:**
Creators → Siloed Communities → Fragmented IP → Dependence on Web2 Platforms

**ESC/APE Future:**
Creators + Fans (NFT Ownership)  
→ Dynamic Landing Pages  
→ Shared Worlds  
→ Co-Owned IP Ecosystem  
→ Decentralized Creative Economies  
→ Shared World Unlock
